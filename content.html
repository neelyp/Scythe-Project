                <h2>The Importance of Morality</h2>
                <h2></h2>
                <p>In a world like in Scythe, where humanity has conquered death, and the Thunderhead makes sure everyone has a place to live and food to eat, and knows everything in the world there is to know, life essentially loses its meaning. Everyone lives&#8212;basically forever&#8212;but no one actually lives. The amazing advances in healthcare and medicine that allow people to constantly be revived and put back together whenever something lethal happens really bring more issues than one would think.</p>
                <p>In the real world, knowing that life is limited motivates people to set goals and strive to achieve them. Mortality allows people to really appreciate the life that they live every day. It also gives life structure and a sense of urgency. In the book, these feelings were attempted to be replicated by the Tonist cults, but due to the massive technological advances made in their world, the true sense of life was not possible for them to reproduce.</p>
                <p>While not everyone in the book would agree, it is my opinion that the immortal aspect of life in the Scythedom removes the joy of living out each day and causes that stagnant feeling that Scythe Curie seeks out in her Gleaning victims.</p>

                    <h3>Citra Terranova</h3>
                    <p>Citra enters her Scythe apprenticeship with apprehension. Like Rowan, she does not want to be in the business of taking life. Under the guidance of Scythe Faraday, she learns how to Glean totally unprejudiced, using data from the Age of Mortality to guide her choices. Then, under Scythe Curie, she learns to have compassion for the family of those she Gleans.</p>

                    <h3>Rowan Damisch</h3>
                    <p>Starting as someone who hated the idea of Gleaning and was willing to sabotage himself to allow Citra to be ordained as a Scythe, Rowan was heavily changed by his apprenticeship under Scythe Goddard. Goddard&apos;s training allowed Rowan to become comfortable taking the lives of others, but also allowed him to witness the corruption and injustices of people who took advantage of their power firsthand. These experiences cause him to become the vigilante Scythe Lucifer, who killed corrupt Scythes after losing to Citra in the final Test.</p>

                    <p>The main example of a truly noble Scythe. Faraday had no concept of corruption and lived a humble life, as Scythes were meant to. All his Gleanings were based purely on Mortal-Age death statistics, and he taught Rowan and Citra how to be good Scythes that had strong morals.</p>

                    <p>Like Scythe Faraday, Scythe Curie treats Gleaning with dignity and does her best to stay moral. Curie teaches Citra how to have compassion for those she Gleans and has a tradition of cooking a meal for the families of those she Gleans, where she asks them about their late relative to get to know them better. Scythe Curie shows that having compassion is possible even as a Scythe and does her best to instill this in her apprentice.</p>

                    <h3>Scythe Goddard</h3>
                    <p>Scythe Goddard serves only himself and treats Gleaning as a game. In the book, his purpose is to show how the essentially unchecked power of a Scythe can fall to corruption. He forcefully displaces people from their massive estates, throws extravagant parties, and has the High Blade in the palm of his hand. Goddard and his crew were known for mass Gleanings and had great joy in killing others. He uses his position as a Scythe to bring him celebrity-like fame.</p>

            <h2>Should the Thunderhead Control Scythes?</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>Thanks to Scythe Goddard, it is made clear that Scythes are extremely susceptible to corruption. After Citra is framed for the &ldquo;murder&rdquo; of Scythe Faraday, the Thunderhead uses a loophole to communicate with Citra while she is in a mostly deadish state (right before getting revived). During this, the Thunderhead talks to Citra about her plan and gives her some advice. As the reader learns from the book, the Thunderhead cannot be discriminatory or prejudiced, and it also does not have any ulterior motives that would cause it to be corrupt. In a world where the Thunderhead also governs everything, and does a good job at it, it would make sense that it could also oversee the Scythes as well.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>In my opinion, it would make sense for the Thunderhead to also be in control of the Scythes, but only because of the blatant corruption that the Scythes had. The reasoning for Scythes to be a separate entity was that humans should be in charge of the people who are responsible for ending human life. This makes sense, and on paper it seems like the only right idea, but in practice, humans are always vulnerable to corruption where there are positions of power, and corrupt people in control of who lives and dies is unacceptable. As a program that is incapable of this corruption, this makes the Thunderhead seem like the obvious choice as a leader for the Scythes as well.</p>
